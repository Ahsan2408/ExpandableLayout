An Android library that lets you create in a simple, fast and hassle-free way a CardView in which you can insert your custom layout and just expand and collapse without even writing a single Java/Kotlin line of code.

Setup
First of all, include the dependency in your app build.gradle:

compile 'com.alespero:expandable-cardview:0.8'
